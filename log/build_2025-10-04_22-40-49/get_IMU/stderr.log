[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findget_imu_data.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "get_imu_data", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "get_imu_data" with
  any of the following names:

    get_imu_dataConfig.cmake
    get_imu_data-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "get_imu_data" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "get_imu_data_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "get_imu_data" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
