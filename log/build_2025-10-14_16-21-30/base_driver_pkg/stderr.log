[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsenson_pkg.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "senson_pkg", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "senson_pkg" with
  any of the following names:

    senson_pkgConfig.cmake
    senson_pkg-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "senson_pkg" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "senson_pkg_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "senson_pkg" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
