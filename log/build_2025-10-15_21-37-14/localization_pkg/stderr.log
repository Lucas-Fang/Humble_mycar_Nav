  By not providing "Findmycar_map_server.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "mycar_map_server", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "mycar_map_server"
  with any of the following names:

    mycar_map_serverConfig.cmake
    mycar_map_server-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "mycar_map_server" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "mycar_map_server_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "mycar_map_server" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
