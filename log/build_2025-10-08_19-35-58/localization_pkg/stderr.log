  By not providing "Findobot_localization.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this

  "obot_localization", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "obot_localization"
  with any of the following names:

    obot_localizationConfig.cmake
    obot_localization-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "obot_localization" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "obot_localization_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "obot_localization" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
